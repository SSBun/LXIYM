## Learn Numbers in English in Y Minutes

Numbers are fundamental to English, used for counting, ordering, mathematics, and everyday descriptions. This guide provides a quick tour of how numbers are expressed and used in English.

### Core Concepts & Usage

#### 1. Cardinal Numbers (How Many?)

Cardinal numbers tell you the quantity of something.

*   **Basic Numbers (0-12):**
    *   0: zero (also "nought" in BrE, or "oh" for digits like phone numbers)
    *   1: one
    *   2: two
    *   3: three
    *   4: four
    *   5: five
    *   6: six
    *   7: seven
    *   8: eight
    *   9: nine
    *   10: ten
    *   11: eleven
    *   12: twelve

*   **Teens (13-19):** Generally end in "-teen".
    *   13: thirteen
    *   14: fourteen
    *   15: fifteen (note spelling)
    *   16: sixteen
    *   17: seventeen
    *   18: eighteen
    *   19: nineteen

*   **Tens (20-90):** Generally end in "-ty".
    *   20: twenty
    *   30: thirty
    *   40: forty (note spelling: no 'u')
    *   50: fifty
    *   60: sixty
    *   70: seventy
    *   80: eighty
    *   90: ninety

*   **Combining Tens and Units (21-99):** Use a hyphen.
    *   21: twenty-one
    *   35: thirty-five
    *   89: eighty-nine

*   **Larger Numbers:**
    *   100: one hundred (or "a hundred")
        *   *Example:* 101 - one hundred and one (BrE often includes "and"; AmE often omits it: "one hundred one")
        *   *Example:* 345 - three hundred and forty-five (or "three hundred forty-five")
    *   1,000: one thousand (or "a thousand")
        *   *Example:* 2,500 - two thousand, five hundred (or "twenty-five hundred" informally)
    *   1,000,000: one million (or "a million")
        *   *Example:* 3,250,000 - three million, two hundred and fifty thousand
    *   1,000,000,000: one billion (or "a billion") - *Note: Historically, "billion" meant a million million in BrE (now mostly aligned with AmE's thousand million).*

    **Usage Note for Hundreds, Thousands, Millions:**
    When these words are used as exact numbers, they are not pluralized.
    *   *Correct:* five hundred people, two thousand years
    *   *Incorrect:* five hundreds people, two thousands years
    However, when used indefinitely, they can be pluralized:
    *   *Example:* "There were *hundreds* of birds." / "He made *thousands* of dollars."

#### 2. Ordinal Numbers (What Order?)

Ordinal numbers tell you the position of something in a sequence. Most end in "-th", but the first few are irregular.

| Cardinal | Word    | Ordinal     | Abbreviation |
| :------- | :------ | :---------- | :----------- |
| 1        | one     | **first**   | 1st          |
| 2        | two     | **second**  | 2nd          |
| 3        | three   | **third**   | 3rd          |
| 4        | four    | four**th**  | 4th          |
| 5        | five    | fif**th**   | 5th          |
| 8        | eight   | eigh**th**  | 8th          |
| 9        | nine    | nin**th**   | 9th          |
| 12       | twelve  | twelf**th** | 12th         |
| 20       | twenty  | twentie**th**| 20th         |
| 21       | twenty-one | twenty-**first** | 21st         |
| 32       | thirty-two | thirty-**second**| 32nd         |
| 100      | one hundred| one hundred**th**| 100th        |

*   *Example:* "She finished in *second* place."
*   *Example:* "It's my *thirtieth* birthday."
*   *Example:* "The *5th* of November."

#### 3. Basic Arithmetic Operations

*   **Addition (+):** plus
    *   *Example:* 2 + 3 = 5 (two *plus* three *equals* five / two *and* three *is* five)
*   **Subtraction (-):** minus / take away
    *   *Example:* 7 - 4 = 3 (seven *minus* four *equals* three / seven *take away* four *is* three)
*   **Multiplication (x or \*):** times / multiplied by
    *   *Example:* 6 x 5 = 30 (six *times* five *equals* thirty / six *multiplied by* five *is* thirty)
*   **Division (รท or /):** divided by
    *   *Example:* 10 รท 2 = 5 (ten *divided by* two *equals* five)

#### 4. Fractions

*   1/2: one half (or "a half")
*   1/3: one third (or "a third")
*   1/4: one quarter (or "a quarter" / "one fourth")
*   1/5: one fifth
*   2/3: two thirds
*   3/4: three quarters (or "three fourths")
*   5/8: five eighths

*   *Example:* "I'll take *half* a cup of sugar."
*   *Example:* "He ate *three quarters* of the pizza."

#### 5. Decimals

The decimal point is read as "point". Digits after the point are read individually.

*   0.5: zero point five (or "nought point five" BrE / "point five")
*   3.14: three point one four
*   22.789: twenty-two point seven eight nine

*   *Example:* "The price is $19.99 (nineteen dollars and ninety-nine cents, or nineteen ninety-nine)."
*   *Example:* "Please measure *2.5* (two point five) meters."

#### 6. Percentages (%)

The symbol % is read as "percent".

*   10%: ten percent
*   50%: fifty percent
*   0.5%: zero point five percent / half a percent

*   *Example:* "There's a *twenty percent* discount."

#### 7. Talking About Zero

*   **zero:** General mathematical term.
    *   *Example:* "The temperature is *zero* degrees Celsius."
*   **nought (BrE):** Often used for the digit 0.
    *   *Example:* "The number is five-nought-two (502)."
*   **oh (AmE & BrE):** Used for the digit 0, especially in phone numbers, room numbers, years.
    *   *Example:* "My room number is four-*oh*-seven (407)."
    *   *Example:* "He was born in nineteen-*oh*-six (1906)."
*   **nil:** Used for scores in some sports (e.g., football/soccer).
    *   *Example:* "The score was two-*nil* (2-0)."
*   **love:** Used in tennis for a score of zero.
    *   *Example:* "Fifteen-*love* (15-0)."

#### 8. Years

*   **Up to 1999:** Usually read as two two-digit numbers.
    *   1984: nineteen eighty-four
    *   1776: seventeen seventy-six
*   **2000:** two thousand
*   **2001-2009:** two thousand and one, two thousand and two, etc. (BrE) / two thousand one, two thousand two (AmE)
    *   2008: two thousand and eight / two thousand eight
*   **2010 onwards:** Can be "two thousand and ten" or "twenty ten".
    *   2023: twenty twenty-three / two thousand and twenty-three

### Where to Go Next?

*   Practice reading numbers aloud (e.g., phone numbers, prices, dates).
*   Listen to native speakers and note how they pronounce and use numbers.
*   Explore more advanced mathematical terms if needed (e.g., square root, exponent).

This quick tour should give you a solid foundation for understanding and using numbers in English. Happy counting!
