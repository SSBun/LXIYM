## Learn Reason Prepositions in English in Y Minutes

Explaining *why* something happens is a common need in communication. Reason prepositions in English help you connect an action or situation to its cause. This guide provides a quick tour of these useful prepositions.

### Core Concepts & Usage

Prepositions of reason introduce the cause or explanation for a statement made in the main part of the sentence. They typically precede a noun or noun phrase.

#### 1. `because of`

This is one of the most common and versatile prepositions of reason. It directly states the cause.

*   **Structure:** Statement + `because of` + noun/noun phrase (the reason).
*   *Example:* The flight was delayed *because of* the bad weather. (Reason: bad weather)
*   *Example:* We couldn't go to the park *because of* the rain. (Reason: the rain)
*   *Example:* He succeeded *because of* his hard work. (Reason: his hard work)

#### 2. `due to`

Often used, especially in more formal contexts, to mean "caused by" or "as a result of." `Due to` traditionally modifies nouns, but it's increasingly used more broadly like `because of`.

*   **Structure:** Statement + `due to` + noun/noun phrase (the reason).
*   *Example:* The cancellation was *due to* unforeseen circumstances. (Reason: unforeseen circumstances)
*   *Example:* Her success is *due to* her dedication. (Reason: her dedication)
*   *Example:* Traffic congestion is often *due to* road construction. (Reason: road construction)
    *   *Note:* Some traditional grammarians prefer `due to` after a form of the verb "to be" (e.g., "The delay *was due to* fog"), but its use is now more widespread.

#### 3. `owing to`

Similar to `due to` and often used in formal or written English. It also means "because of" or "as a result of."

*   **Structure:** Statement + `owing to` + noun/noun phrase (the reason).
*   *Example:* *Owing to* a lack of funding, the project was canceled. (Reason: a lack of funding) (Can start a sentence)
*   *Example:* The match was postponed *owing to* the heavy rain. (Reason: the heavy rain)

#### 4. `on account of`

This is another, somewhat more formal way to express "because of."

*   **Structure:** Statement + `on account of` + noun/noun phrase (the reason).
*   *Example:* He was absent *on account of* illness. (Reason: illness)
*   *Example:* *On account of* the strike, many services were disrupted. (Reason: the strike)

#### 5. `thanks to`

Used when the reason is something positive or has led to a good outcome. It implies gratitude or a fortunate cause.

*   **Structure:** Statement + `thanks to` + noun/noun phrase (the positive reason).
*   *Example:* We arrived on time *thanks to* your excellent directions. (Reason: your excellent directions)
*   *Example:* *Thanks to* her efforts, the event was a huge success. (Reason: her efforts)
*   *Example:* The plants survived *thanks to* the timely rain. (Reason: the timely rain)

#### 6. `for` (as a reason)

`For` can indicate the reason or purpose, especially when followed by a noun phrase that explains why something is done or why a feeling exists.

*   **Structure:** Often in phrases like "famous *for*", "punished *for*", "sorry *for*".
*   *Example:* He is famous *for* his paintings. (The reason for his fame)
*   *Example:* She was praised *for* her bravery. (The reason for her praise)
*   *Example:* They couldn't speak *for* laughing. (The laughter was the reason they couldn't speak)

#### 7. `from` (as a source or cause)

`From` can indicate that something results or originates from a particular cause or state, often an involuntary one.

*   **Structure:** Statement describing a result + `from` + noun/noun phrase (the cause/source).
*   *Example:* He suffers *from* allergies. (Allergies are the cause of his suffering)
*   *Example:* She was trembling *from* cold. (Cold was the cause of her trembling)
*   *Example:* Many people died *from* the disease. (The disease was the cause of death)

#### 8. `through` (as a result of a process or situation)

`Through` can indicate that something happened as a result of a particular situation, circumstance, or process, sometimes implying carelessness or a specific channel.

*   **Structure:** Statement + `through` + noun/noun phrase (the mediating cause/situation).
*   *Example:* He lost the documents *through* carelessness. (Carelessness was the means/reason for losing them)
*   *Example:* She got the job *through* a friend. (A friend was the channel/reason she got the job)
*   *Example:* They achieved success *through* perseverance. (Perseverance was the process that led to success)
